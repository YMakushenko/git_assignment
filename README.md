# Git Assignment - YMakushenko
a. An issue is a feature request, bug report, or general task that needs to be addressed within a repository. It serves as a centralized place for discussion, planning, and tracking progress.
b. A pull request (PR) is a proposed change to a repository submitted by a user. It allows collaborators to review and discuss the proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.
c. To open a pull request, follow these steps:
1.	Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
2.	Create a new branch from the main branch.
3.	Make your changes in the new branch.
4.	Push your branch to your forked repository.
5.	Visit the original repository and open a pull request from your branch to the main branch.
d. To add someone to your repository, follow these steps:
1.	Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2.	Go to the Settings tab.
3.	Click on Manage access.
4.	Click on Invite a collaborator and enter the collaborator's GitHub username or email address.
5.	Select the appropriate permission level.
6.	Click Add [username] to invite the collaborator.

e. Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. GitHub is a platform built around Git, providing hosting for repositories, collaboration features like issue tracking and pull requests, and additional tools for project management.
f. git diff is a command used to display the differences between two commits, between a commit and the working directory, or between two branches. It shows which lines have been added, modified, or deleted between the compared versions.
g. The main branch is the primary branch in a Git repository. It often serves as the default branch and is where the latest changes are integrated. In many repositories, the main branch is named main or master.
h. No, it's generally not recommended to push changes directly to the main branch. Instead, it's best practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, make and commit your changes to that branch, and then open a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch after they've been reviewed.
